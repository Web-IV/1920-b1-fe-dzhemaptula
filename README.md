# Zound

Backend: https://github.com/Web-IV/1920-b1-be-dzhemaptula

Website is running on: www.dzhem.ysebie.com
Find the RESTful API swagger on: www.dzhem.ysebie.com/swagger

Use the following account for login:

- Username: web4
- Password: password

The site has HTTPS, so do not worry about your passwords being stolen.
Everything is hashed and stored in the database without a way to unhash them.

(But still; do not use any real passwords. This is not a real site you will be using at this moment.)

You should have a friend request from dzhemaptula right after logging in.
You can use this to test some functionality with posts etc.

All other users can be used with their usernames and password "password"

# What is it?

Zound is a social media in it's early stages. It is a huge project to work on, currently having some key functions like searching/adding friends, and showing their posts.

The goal is to continue this project and over time create a social media website where people go to when they want to talk about music and relax by listening to songs synced with other people.
